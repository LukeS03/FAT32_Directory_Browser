# FAT32 Directory Entry Browser

A FAT32 directory entry browser written in Java. Very rough and unpolished. I started writing this to rescue some save-files from a MicroSD card I was using on my 3DS.

# ToDo:
* Properly comment my code 

## Intended Features
* Browse directories
* Manually set CHS values or extract them from file system image.
* Mark files to be extracted
* Extract files using only their start cluster and their file size.
* CLI parameters controlled by GNU getopt.

## Super duper distant hypothetical ideas
* Search for deleted or 'orphaned' directories in a file-system image.
