# FAT32 Directory Entry Browser

A FAT32 directory entry browser written in Java. Very rough and unpolished. I started writing this to rescue some save-files from a MicroSD card I was using on my 3DS.

## Intended Features:
* Browse directories
* Manually set CHS values or extract them from file system image.
* Mark files to be extracted
* Extract files using only their start cluster and their file size.

## Super duper distant hypothetical ideas:
* Search for deleted or 'orphaned' directories in a file-system image.
